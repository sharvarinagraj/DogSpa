Advantages of React

1.Virtual DOM
The original DOM is represented by virtual DOM.
Whenever the app is modified or updated, UI is rendered again by the virtual DOM, by updating the components that have been modified. This improves speed and responsiveness

2.JSX
JSX is one of the best features of React JS as it makes it super easy for developers to write the building blocks.

3. Declarative UI
This feature makes React code more readable and easier to fix bugs. React JS is the best platform to develop UIs that are both exciting and engaging not just for web apps, but mobile apps as well.

4. Component Based Architecture
user interface of an app based on React JS is made up of several components, with each of them having its particular logic, written in JS.
React JS components play a huge part in deciding the app visuals and interactions.
